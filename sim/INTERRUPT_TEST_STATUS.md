# Interrupt System Test Status

## ✓ VERIFIED - Working Correctly

### Core Interrupt Handling (tb_simple_irq_test.sv)
- [x] IRQ vector at 0x10 correctly jumps to interrupt handler
- [x] Interrupt handler prologue saves registers correctly
- [x] C function `irq_handler()` is called and executes
- [x] Interrupt handler epilogue restores registers correctly
- [x] `retirq` instruction returns from interrupt correctly
- [x] `maskirq` instruction enables interrupts (PicoRV32 custom instruction)
- [x] LATCHED_IRQ mechanism latches interrupts correctly
- [x] Counter increments exactly once per IRQ trigger
- [x] No spurious re-entries with clock-synchronized pulses

**Test Result:** 10 testbench IRQ triggers → 10 firmware handler executions → PASS

**Method:** Manually forced `timer_irq` signal with single clock cycle pulses

## ⚠️ NOT YET TESTED - Status Unknown

### Timer Peripheral Hardware
- [ ] Timer peripheral generates IRQ signal when counter reaches compare value
- [ ] Timer counter increments correctly
- [ ] Timer compare register loads correctly from firmware writes
- [ ] Timer enable bit functions correctly
- [ ] Timer IRQ output connects to CPU IRQ input

**Current Status:** UNKNOWN - We bypassed the timer peripheral in our test

---

## Next Steps

1. **Test Timer Peripheral:** Create/run test that verifies timer hardware generates interrupts
2. **Only if timer test fails:** Investigate and fix timer peripheral issues
3. **If timer test passes:** Timer peripheral is working, original issue was elsewhere

---

## Key Finding

The manual IRQ test PASSED, which proves:
- Interrupt handling mechanism: ✓ WORKING
- Timer peripheral: ? NOT TESTED YET

We should NOT assume the timer needs modification until we actually test it.
