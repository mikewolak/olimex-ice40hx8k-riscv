### Build System
- **Automatic toolchain management** - Downloads and builds required tools
- **Platform verification** - Ensures correct build environment (x86-64 Linux)
- **Reproducible builds** - Version-pinned dependencies
- **Comprehensive reports** - Gate utilization, timing, tool versions
- **Artifact packaging** - Creates release tarballs with git tags

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

The build system requires **x86-64 Linux**. Ubuntu, Debian, Fedora, RHEL, Arch, and other distributions are supported.

Run platform verification to check your system:
```bash
bash scripts/verify-platform.sh
```

If build tools are missing, the script will provide distribution-specific installation commands.

**Minimum requirements:**
- gcc, g++, make
- git
- wget or curl
- tar

**All other dependencies** (FPGA tools, RISC-V toolchain) are automatically downloaded and built by the Makefile.

### Building

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/mikewolak/olimex-ice40hx8k-picorv32.git
cd olimex-ice40hx8k-picorv32

# Build everything (toolchain, gateware, firmware, host tools)
make

# This will:
# 1. Verify platform requirements
# 2. Download oss-cad-suite (Yosys, NextPNR, icetime)
# 3. Download and build RISC-V GCC toolchain
# 4. Build bootloader
# 5. Synthesize FPGA bitstream
# 6. Build all firmware examples
# 7. Build host uploader tool
# 8. Generate artifacts and build report
```

**Build time:** Approximately 30-45 minutes on a modern system (first build includes toolchain compilation).

### Artifacts

After building, all outputs are collected in the `artifacts/` directory:

```
artifacts/
├── host/
│   └── fw_upload              # Firmware uploader tool
├── gateware/
│   └── ice40_picorv32.bin     # FPGA bitstream
├── firmware/
│   ├── led_blink.bin          # LED blink demo
│   ├── timer_clock.bin        # Real-time clock
│   ├── hexedit.bin            # Interactive hex editor
│   ├── mandelbrot_float.bin   # Mandelbrot set (floating point)
│   ├── mandelbrot_fixed.bin   # Mandelbrot set (fixed point)

│   ├── heap_test.bin          # Dynamic memory test
│   └── ...                    # More examples
└── build-report.txt           # Comprehensive build report
```

A versioned tarball is also created: `artifacts/olimex-ice40hx8k-picorv32-<tag>-<timestamp>.tar.gz`

## Usage

### Programming the FPGA

Use the Olimex programmer tool to load the bitstream:

```bash
# Program FPGA with bitstream
olimexino-32u4 -p artifacts/gateware/ice40_picorv32.bin

# Or use iceprog if available
iceprog artifacts/gateware/ice40_picorv32.bin
```

### Connecting to the Bootloader

The bootloader runs automatically after FPGA configuration:

```bash
# Connect via minicom (Linux)
minicom -D /dev/ttyUSB0 -b 115200

# Or screen
screen /dev/ttyUSB0 115200

# Or picocom
picocom -b 115200 /dev/ttyUSB0
```

**Bootloader commands:**
- `help` - Show available commands
- `upload` - Enter firmware upload mode
- `jump` - Execute uploaded firmware
- `read <addr>` - Read memory
- `write <addr> <data>` - Write memory

### Uploading Firmware

Use the `fw_upload` host tool to send firmware to the bootloader:

```bash
# List available serial ports
artifacts/host/fw_upload --list

# Upload firmware
artifacts/host/fw_upload -p /dev/ttyUSB0 artifacts/firmware/led_blink.bin

# Upload with verbose output
artifacts/host/fw_upload -p /dev/ttyUSB0 artifacts/firmware/timer_clock.bin -v
```

The uploader features:
- Beautiful progress bar with speed/ETA
- Rotating ACK protocol for reliability
- CRC32 verification
- Cross-platform (Linux, macOS, Windows)

- **Achieved frequency**: 63.95 MHz (15.64 ns period)
- **Timing margin**: 13.95 MHz (27.9%)

**FPGA utilization:**

## Known Issues and Notes

### Yosys 0.58+ ABC9 Optimization
Yosys 0.58 and later have an ABC9 optimization issue that can cause CRC32 state machine corruption. The current build uses optimized SRAM controller with ABC9 disabled for stability. See `YOSYS_ABC9_ISSUE.md` for details.

### SRAM Controller
The system uses a 5-cycle SRAM access pattern for reliability. A 4-cycle optimized version exists but may have timing issues on some boards. The stable 5-cycle version is default.

## Development

### Adding New Firmware

1. Create your `.c` file in `firmware/`
2. Add your target to `firmware/Makefile`
3. Build with: `make TARGET=yourapp firmware`
4. Upload with: `artifacts/host/fw_upload -p /dev/ttyUSB0 firmware/yourapp.bin`

### Modifying HDL

1. Edit files in `hdl/`
2. Rebuild bitstream: `make synthesis pnr bitstream`
3. Program FPGA with new bitstream

### Using Newlib C Standard Library

Firmware applications can use standard C library functions (printf, scanf, malloc, etc.) by building with `USE_NEWLIB=1`:

```bash
make TARGET=yourapp USE_NEWLIB=1 firmware
```

The syscalls bridge in `lib/syscalls/` provides UART-based I/O for newlib.
